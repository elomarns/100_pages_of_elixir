### Recursion

Recursion is an approach to solve problems through functions where the function calls itself many times, solving a small fraction of the problem in each call. It only stops when it hits a base case, then it returns the result up to the stack of previous calls. Recursion is heavily used in functional languages, and many functions from Elixir has recursive behavior.

It's so important to understand and be able to write recursive code when using a functional programming language that we have a whole chapter about that. So I won't take too long discussing recursion here, but I also couldn't talk about functional programming without mentioning it.
