### Variables

Variable names in Elixir must start with a UTF-8 lowercase letter or an underscore, followed by UTF-8 letters, underscores or numbers. It can also end with `!` or `?`.

Even though a variable name can contain uppercase letters, the convention dictates they should only have lowercase letters, and its words must be separated by underscores. This naming convention is usually called `snake_case`.

Here are some examples of valid variable names:

```plaintext
age
favorite_pokemon
_last_name
top_10_games
save!
valid?
översätt_inte_detta
```
