### Strings

Strings in Elixir are a little more complicated than in most languages. But don't worry, we have a whole chapter to talk about them. For now, you just need to know you can create a string by enclosing its content with double quotes (`"`):

```irb
iex(1)> "Are you enjoying this book?"
"Are you enjoying this book?"
```

This is enough for you to understand the code examples in the next chapters before we discuss strings in more detail.
