### Lists

Lists are collections of values where the values can be of any type. You can create a list enclosing its content in braces:

```irb
iex(1)> my_favorite_games_and_numbers = ["The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time", 1985, :final_fantasy_8, 3.14]
["The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time", 1985, :final_fantasy_8, 3.14]
```

There's a lot more to know about lists, that's why they also have its own chapter.
