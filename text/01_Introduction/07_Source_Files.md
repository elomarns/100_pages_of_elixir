### Source files

You can store code written in Elixir using one of these 2 file extensions:

* `.ex`: if you plan to keep your compiled code, this is the file extension you should use. Most of your application code should be stored in `.ex` files.
* `.exs`: this is the file extension to use when you just want your code to be interpreted right away, without keeping its compiled version. This is used mostly for test files, scripts and config files.

But it's important to know this is just a convention. You can run an `.ex` file without compiling it, as well as you can compile an `.exs` file. Elixir treats them the same way.
