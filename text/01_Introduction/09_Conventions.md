### Conventions

Every programming language has its own set of conventions about how you should write code, and Elixir is no different. However, even though there's [official documentation about Elixir naming conventions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/naming-conventions.html), Elixir doesn't have an official style guide. But among the ones created by the community, there's [a style guide maintained by a member of Elixir core team](https://github.com/lexmag/elixir-style-guide). It's mostly aligned with Elixir's source code, so you should at least consider to follow it.

But if you want other options, you can take a look at [the most popular between the Elixir style guides](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide), or [the style guide used by Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/elixir-style-guide) (a static code analysis tool for Elixir).
