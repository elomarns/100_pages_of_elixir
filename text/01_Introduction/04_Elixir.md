### Elixir

Jos√© Valim was a prominent Ruby developer who was searching for a better solution to the concurrency problem than the one Ruby was offering. In his search, he found Erlang, and he fell in love. But as someone used to Ruby, he missed things like a concise syntax, metaprogramming, polymorphism, and better tooling. To address these points, he created Elixir.

Elixir is a modern functional programing language that compiles to BEAM. It has the best of two worlds: a friendly syntax, and a robust VM. This way Elixir takes advantage of what makes Erlang great (the platform) while improving what it's not up to today's standards (the language). But as both languages compile to the same VM, you can use all the existing Erlang code with Elixir, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

As a result of its more approachable syntax, Elixir is easier to use in a wide variety of domains. And as many of the problems we have today seem to fit really well on Erlang's runtime, Elixir already has [a great framework for web development](https://phoenixframework.org/), [a framework for multimedia streaming](https://www.membraneframework.org/), [a framework for embedded software](https://nerves-project.org/), and many useful libraries.

Since its initial release in 2011, Elixir is growing steady. And thanks to its vibrant community, it's getting better every day. So if you want to write reliable concurrent applications using a modern language, Elixir is a fantastic tool for the job.
